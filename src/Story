You wake up in a dark room that smells like medicine. There is a white door in front of you and a black door to your back. You reach into your pockets and notice that everything is gone. Your keys, your phone, everything. All you have left are some gray sweatpants, a gray t-shirt with a rocket on it, and a leather backpack that you don't remember owning. The room is empty except for one piece of furniture in the room, a painting.
